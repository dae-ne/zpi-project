# ZPI Project

## Kanban board

When creating a new item in the Kanban board, add a prefix to the item/issue name indicating the team name. This will make it easier to filter tasks.

**Prefixes for tasks:**
- `[ui]`
- `[front]` (frontend)
- `[back]` (backend)
- `[docs]` (documentation)
- `[pres]` (presentation/marketing)
- `[devops]` (DevOps)
- `[db]` (database)

Example: `[front] Create login page`

## Client code generation

Client ts code (DTOs and services) is autogenerated from an OpenAPI json file. To generate client code, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
node run sync
```

You can check if the client code is already in sync by running:

```bash
node run test
```

Note that the `openapi.json` file must be in the root directory of the project. The file is auto generated on build of the backend Recipe.WebApi project (condition - configuration='Debug').
